        <p>
            As I was working on the function 'whereAreYou' in the testing program 'Built-in Methods' I had trouble solving the problem. I would try different methods to solve the problem.  It was giving me the following string
            [{door: 1, hiding: "Scooby"}] 
            The door number need to be extracted and returned as the answer for the test to pass.
        </p>
        <h2 class="cursive">Solved a problem in an elegant way</h2>
        <p>
            When I started the write the code and to solve the issue I didn't use a technique call Psuedocode. Psuedocode is writing method wherein plain English and then translating it into code. I just started Reading error messages and the issue, old Systems analyst technique that I quite familiar with. 
            After struggling along trying to solve the code I decided to go into campus and asked the assistance of Emily, who is a coach. She did as all teachers do, pointed me in the direction and showed me where to look. It a great way for a teacher to teach you, where they showed you where to get the answer and you learn how to look from it. So after doing more research, and finding the solution, I was able to resolve the issue.
            When you are stuck on a problem look at different avenues to solve the issue, it a treasure hunt which you find the answer but also learn along the way.
