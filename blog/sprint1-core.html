    <h1 class="cursive">Sprint One - Identity, Values and Strengths Activity</h1>
    <br>
    <h2 class="cursive">Core Personal Values</h2>
    <h4 class="cursive">Honesty</h4>
    <p>
        Honesty for me is about expressing and representing myself truthfully, through words and behaviour. Giving others the best possible opportunity to see who you are without deception.
    </p>
    <h4class="cursive">Curiosity</h4>
    <p>
        "There is always a greater truth to find â€“ no answer is final, no opinion is beyond scrutiny, no theory is unable to be further tested"
    </p>
    <h4 class="cursive">Courage</h4>
    <p>
        To willingly experience uncomfortable sensations and events in order to live with integrity.
    </p>
    <h4 class="cursive">Acceptance</h4>
     <P>
        To choose to perceive reality as neutral - neither good or bad - and to allow the outer world to react unmolested to you, your actions, and your behaviour.
     </P>
     <br>
     <h1 class="cursive">Ethical decision</h1>
     <p>
        Choosing the right situation where I'd made an ethical decision, and writing was a challenge. As an IT support specialist, I had access to a lot of data - financial, legal, executive, and employment relationships.  
        As a privileged user, Administrator, I chose only to access this data as required e.g. restoring backups, password resets, monitoring data access, email communication, and folder permission changes. If unsure about a request regarding data access, I would consult with HR, manager, client or owner of the data.
        This decision was a daily decision that it became second nature to me. This will decision will come up again as a Developer. Access to data and information is power, and with that power comes responsibility and trust.
     </p>
     <h1 class="cursive">Culture Influence</h1>
     <p>
        As a South Africa immigrant at the age of 13 years old, I've experienced and observed multiple cultures. 
        New Zealand is a place where you can be open and honest. New Zealand has an environment that gives me opportunities to live by my values free. This allows me to test how I am. 
        For me Values and Identity are dynamic, changing as we grow and expertise life. Culture is just one of many experiences that both influence and challenges our  Values and Identity. As an immigrant, I learned to both be open and challenging while being myself. What I am saying is that I am still exploring who I am, and that's who I am.
     </p>
