    <h4 class="cursive">My Strengths and Limitations</h4>
        <p>
            Curiosity can be both a strength and limitation. As a strength it can be used for exploring way on how created content, web pages and Apps, and to resolve issue, troubled shooting and researching. Also exploring how technology works, psychology(An interest of mine), and behaviour. 
    This Curiosity also be a disadvantage, I can get distracted in a unrelated area that is not relevant to the study material. For example researching python when studying JavaScript. This behaviour has the nickname - Shiny Syndrome.
        </p>
    <h4 class="cursive">Managing Workload</h4>
        <p>
            Having previous experience in the Technology and having technical knowledge will provide me with the benefit of integrating  new ideas. 
            One of the limitations I really want to work on and make a strength is time management. As my previous roles have never had real deadlines to be fulfilled, I have been able to complete projects in my own time.
            I believe that my focus should be on time management, being proactive, mindful and scheduling. 

            Time management will be managed by constantly using an app called GrindStone. Put in practice time being billed for client.

            Being mindful of when I get distracted and noticing the triggers. Once I have noticed getting distracted. Noted it down and recorded the suspected time of being distracted. 
            Being more proactive, scheduling and planning. 
        </p>

    <h4 class="cursive">Working and Learning As a Team</h4>
        <p>
            By planning and scheduling in a team, we can evenly distribution the workload evenly, an utilizing work by each team member strength. For example if I'll write the code for a Web page and if my team member is great at writing reports or manual for the code.
            Another Example is planning and scheduling the projected stages with the team. During this planning stage each member can let the others know where which areas need assistance with. This could a learning opportunity for them, by having another team member assisting them in that area. The great way to learn something is to teach it to somebody else.
        </p>
    <h4 class="cursive">Asking For assistance</h4>
        <p>
            If I am unable to understand the issue using resource and stagiest like google and the Rubber duck method, I'll reached out to my fellow students and see if they have come across this issue. During foundations, where working remotely  I would use the Foundations form on Slake.  Then I'll ask facilitator for assistance either though Slack or going to on campus support.
        </p>
    <h4 class="cursive">Dev-Academy facilitation team</h4>
        <p>
            I see Facilitation member who can guide me through my learning journey to become a great developer. As well, the Can deliver the knowledge about developing and the industry to there best ability. Someone who I am accountable to believe my best work to. 
        </p>
